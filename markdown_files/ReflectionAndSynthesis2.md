# Reflection and Synthesis
## Feedback and decisions
+ A suggestion for data collection was to go to the 3rd floor of the academic
center for creating a map since the location had few windows and obstacles had
clean edges. We plan to go there to try gathering data
+ Suggestions to speed up program:
  + decrease resolution
  + look into priority queues for storing values
  + use the tips in class like profiling to find the issue

## Review process reflection
+ We did get good answers to our key questions that were useful.
+ We should have described A star better and gone through more about the algorithm and how it works, for example explain how A star picks which pixel to explore next.
+ We stuck closely to our agenda and went through our powerpoint smoothly.
+ We got suggestions for optimal map collection locations given our current constraints.
+ We were in a pretty good spot at the time and didn't really need help with our code or structure at the time of the review.
