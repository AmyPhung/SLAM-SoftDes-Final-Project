# Project Proposal

## The Big Idea:
The main idea of the project is to learn about SLAM. We are currently unsure about what we will generate, since the scope of our final product depends on what we find to be reasonably doable after reading various documentation.  Our minimum viable product is to implement the ROS version for using with hector slam, or using the navigation node in ros for path planning. Our reach goal is to create a software using SLAM to allow a robot to navigate through a preexisting map.

## Learning Goals: 
Amy: Learn about SLAM and gain experience working in GitHub with branches
Nathan: Learn more about how to make a robot find a way through a map in the best way.
Sherrie: Learn how to use SLAM and how to make the robot navigate through a given map

## Implementation Plan: 
+ Read papers regarding Slam and G2O.
+ Either use virtual environment for robot navigation or Enido Robot
+ Try implementing hector slam for mapping and navigation node in ros for path planning

## Project schedule: 
+ Week 1: Learn about Slam algorithms and libraries and try different ROS packages as a start
+ Week 2: Either design the virtual environment or get ros bags.
+ Week 3-4: Implement something basic that relates to SLAM leaning heavily on powerful pre-built libraries
+ Week 5-6: Learn about how the pre-built libraries work and replace some of the libraries with our own code

## Collaboration plan:
Attempt to divide up the work as much as possible so that code can be independent from each other during the development process. Work will be done in git branches then merged at the end.

## Risks:
Unable to get a basic implementation while leaning heavily on pre-built libraries or spending too much time on the basic implementation and not having enough time to go beyond that (but still not have enough for a project)

## Additional Course Content: 
Using libraries with python and ROS.
