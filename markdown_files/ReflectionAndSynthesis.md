# Reflection and Synthesis
## Feedback and decisions
+ Suggestions/things to consider-Make it different from QEA. Based on this feedback, we will make sure that the algorithm chosen does not resemble the Flow Field method that we are doing in QEA
+ Applications/take it further-pick up “coins” in optimal way, Create 3D map, find shortest route to dining hall from anywhere on campus, roomba. Therefore, if we finish the core part of our project, we will likely try to implement a 
+ Research on other potential algorithms for path finding
Key Questions:
+ Other algorithms
     - Since most people are not familiar with the topic, we did not get useful insights. We are going to do more research for other potentials.
+ Applications
     - We got a number of interesting suggestions to push our project beyond robot navigation. 
+ Overlap with QEA
     - Our project does not overlap with the last module in QEA since the way to approach this navigation problem is different. In QEA, we focus more on the mathematical concepts and theories behind finding a path in QEA, the method to approach. Whereas for our project, we focus more on the communication with the robot and implementation of path finding for planar environment.
## Review process reflection
+ Review: We got the information that we were looking for but not as much technical information compared to ideas (as expected, since this was a specific subject that we didn’t expect our audience to know a whole lot about). Process-wise, there wasn’t a whole lot of energy during the review which might have been better if it was a two-way small group discussion instead of the presenter/audience structure we used.
+ We gave about the right amount of context for our goals, as it seemed like most people got a handle on our project enough to answer our questions.
+ We stuck pretty closely to our agenda, only improvising how long for each section due to not knowing how long the review was supposed to be. 
+ For a more effective technical review, we could have asked more questions that we know that our audience
