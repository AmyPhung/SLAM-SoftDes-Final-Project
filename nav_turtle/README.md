# nav_turtle

This package should be saved in `~/catkin_ws/src` and built with `catkin_make`in order to work properly. The structure and content of this package is largely derived from the ROS package turtlebot_stage (see source code here: https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_simulator/tree/indigo/turtlebot_stage)
