# Demonstration
We start out by getting the following map from Lidar data from the TurtleBot.

![Example Map of the Library](img/library_lower_day2.png)

Then we select two points in the map that we want the robot to traverse, and our program draws a path on the map.

Then our program will send this path to another script that has a simulated robot traverse the path in real time.

A short gif of how A* finds the best path through a maze.
