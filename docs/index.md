## Getting Started

Originally, we were interested in learning about SLAM and worked on a projected focusing on localization or simultaneous mapping. We realized our constraints in both time and ability to scope the project in a 6 week length while exploring different examples of SLAM during the first phase of project. Therefore, we pivoted and decided to focus our project on a navigation algorithm that can be performed on maps created by prebuilt SLAM algorithm such as Ros gmapping and Hector SLAM and a simulation of a turtlebot autonomously navigating through a given path in a map.
