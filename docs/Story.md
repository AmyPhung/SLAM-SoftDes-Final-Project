# Story/Learning Goals

Originally, the members were interested in learning about SLAM and worked on a project focusing on localization or simultaneous mapping. While exploring different examples of SLAM during the first phase of project, we realized our constraints in both time and ability to scope the project in a 6 week domain. Therefore, we pivoted and decided to focus our project on a navigation algorithm that can be performed on maps created by pre_built SLAM algorithm such as Ros gmapping and Hector SLAM and a simulation of a turtlebot autonomously navigating through a given path in a map.
Our learning goals are learning how to implement different Ros packages
