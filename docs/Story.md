# Story/Learning Goals

Originally, the members were interested in learning about SLAM and worked on a project focusing on localization or simultaneous mapping. While exploring different examples of SLAM during the first phase of project, we realized our constraints in both time and ability to scope the project in a 6 week domain. Therefore, we pivoted and decided to focus our project on a navigation algorithm that can be performed on maps created by pre_built SLAM algorithm such as Ros gmapping and Hector SLAM. Besides the navigation aspect, we also want to simulate a turtlebot autonomously navigating through a given path in a map. Our goals for the current version of our project are to use the concept of A* and write an algorithm for path finding and be able to implement different Ros packages for map data collection and running a simulation.
